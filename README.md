Welcome to the image-resizer!

Tired of scaling and saving images in GIMP?  How about copy pasting filenames to build your html figure for your responsive images?

Now you can just use this nifty laravel app and it will do all the work for you.  Just set the horizontal widths you want for your image, upload the image, and BAM!!!  Just copy/paste the code and move the images to where you want them and your done!
